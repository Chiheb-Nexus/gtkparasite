Installation Instructions
=========================

Installing gtkparasite is pretty simple.

Before you begin, make sure you have the GTK+ development headers installed.
You can find this on your package management tool.

We also recommend the Python development headers.


If you're using GTK 2, then run:

    $ ./autogen.sh --with-gtk=2.0


If you're using GTK 3, then instead run:

    $ ./autogen.sh --with-gtk=3.0


Then run:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install
