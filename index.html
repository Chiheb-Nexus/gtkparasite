     Developing and debugging UIs can be a pain. When something goes wrong,
     it's not always obvious why. You can waste hours writing logging
     statements only to find out that a widget is in the wrong container, or an
     attribute wasn't set correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Developing isn't much better either. Ever spend time writing temporary
     code just to test a new feature, code you know you're going to throw away
     in an hour, and yet you end up spending the next 20 minutes debugging your
     temporary code? Sucks, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     What your program really needs is a good Parasite infestation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parasite is a debugging and development tool that runs inside your GTK+
     application's process. It can inspect your application, giving you
     detailed information on your UI, such as the hierarchy, X window IDs,
     widget properties, and more. You can modify properties on the fly in order
     to experiment with the look of your UI.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you can go further than that. You can actually <i>modify</i> your
     application logic while the program is running! Parasite includes an
     embedded Python shell that lets you write new code that directly interacts
     with your application's UI, regardless of the language the application is
     written in. Create new dialogs, attach temporary signal handlers to
     buttons, test out new logic, and gather additional debug information.
	</p>
    <p>
     If you've used <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, it's
     sort of like that, but for GTK+ applications.
